## About
Substrate Archiver is an ETL archive pipeline for [Substrate](https://substrate.io/) networks. It's the simplest way to interface with WeaveVM's permanent data feature without smart contract redeployments. Check [WeaveVM Archiver](https://github.com/weaveVM/wvm-archiver) for EVM networks archive pipeline.

### WeaveVM Archiver Usage

Substrate Archiver is the ideal choice if you want to:

- Interface with WeaveVM's permanent data settlement and high-throughput DA
- Maintain your current data settlement or DA architecture
- Have an interface with WeaveVM without rollup smart contract redeployments
- Avoid codebase refactoring

## Build & Run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weaveVM/substrate-archiver.git

cd substrate-archiver

cargo shuttle run
```

### Prerequisites & Dependencies

While a WeaveVM Substrate node can run without web2 component dependencies, this node implementation uses [planetscale](https://planetscale.com) for cloud indexing (indexing target network block ID to WVM archive TXID) and [shuttle.rs](https://shuttle.rs) for backend hosting. Check [.env.example](./env.example) to set up your environment variables.

```js
archiver_pk="" // WeaveVM archiver PK
backfill_pk="" // WeaveVM backfill PK
backfill_start_block="0" // it defaults to 0 (genesis), but it's dynamic, so you can specify from which block number you want to start backfilling
network="./networks/your_network.json"
ps_livesync_table_name="LivesyncTableName"
ps_backfill_table_name="BackfillTableName"

DATABASE_HOST="" // planetscale
DATABASE_USERNAME="" // planetscale
DATABASE_PASSWORD="" // planetscale
```

### Add Your Network

To start archiving your network block data on WeaveVM:

1. Add your network config file to the [networks](./networks/) directory.
2. Name your config file using snake_case syntax (e.g., `your_network_name.json`).
3. Modify properties that don't have a `wvm_` prefix in the config JSON file. Check [_template.json](./networks/_template.json) guide
4. Fund your `archiver_address` & `backfill_address` with a sufficient amount of tWVM (1 MB costs ~ 5 cents). Check out [WVM Faucet](https://wvm.dev/faucet) to claim $tWVM. Make sure that the two addresses are distinct.
5. Choose a unique `archive_pool_address` that's different from your `archiver_address` & `backfill_address`
6. set `start_block` value to the most recent network's blockheight. That will facilitate the archiver to start in sync with live blockheight while, in parallel, reindexing from genesis using the `backfill_address`. 
7. Set up your PlanetScale DB according to `db_schema.sql`.

#### Parallel Threads of Archiving

As mentioned previously, `archiver_address` is responsible for archiving blocks starting from the `start_block` specified in your `network.json` config file, while also keeping up with the networkâ€™s current blockheight (live sync). Meanwhile, `backfill_address` handles archiving blocks from `backfill_start_block` up to `start_block`.

```txt
backfill thread: backfill_start_block -> start_block
live sync thread: start_block -> network's live blockheight
```

## How it works

The WeaveVM Substrate node operates as follows:

1. It starts downloading the target substrate network block data from the RPC you provide in the network config file.
2. The node begins pulling blocks from the `start_block` defined in the network's config file.
3. The block data is then serialized in [borsh](https://borsh.io) format and compressed using Brotli.
4. The serialized-compressed data is pushed to WeaveVM as calldata transaction from the `archiver_address` & `backfill_address` to the `archive_pool_address`.
5. Simultaneously, the resulting TXID from pushing data to WeaveVM and the archived substrate block ID are indexed in the cloud for faster data retrieval.

## Server Methods

As mentioned, PlanetScale is used for cloud indexing, which allows a WeaveVM Archiver node to expose its WeaveVM data as a RESTful API.
